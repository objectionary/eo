# @todo #3706:30min Unreadable error message if program declaration is invalid.
#  Improve error message for the case when a program declaration is invalid.
#  The error message should be more informative and should point to the exact
#  place in the input where the error occurred. Moreover xml should be clear
#  what to do to fix the error. 'simple-application-named.yaml' has the same issue.
