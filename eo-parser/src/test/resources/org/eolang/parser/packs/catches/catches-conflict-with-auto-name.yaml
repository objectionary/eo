# @todo #3147:30min Make duplicate names catcher more powerful. This test pack is disabled now
#  because names duplication is not caught here. It happens because of "duplicate-names.xsl" thinks
#  that abstract objects in the tests are on the different levels. Syntactically they are, but
#  semantically they're not. So we need to make this duplicate catcher more powerful, enable the
#  test by removing "skip: true" line and make sure it works.
