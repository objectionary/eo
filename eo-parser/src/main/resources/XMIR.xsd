    <xs:appinfo>The XMIR schema is used to validate the XMIR documents, which are generated by the EO parser.</xs:appinfo>
    <xs:documentation>
      Every XMIR document is essentially an XML document that
      contains objects found in a EOLANG program together with
      supplementary information, such as metas, and so on.
      The schema is used to validate the XMIR documents, which are
      generated by the EO parser. The schema defines the structure
      of the XMIR document, including the elements and attributes
      that are allowed, their types, and any constraints that must
      be satisfied. By validating the XMIR documents against this
      schema, developers can ensure that the documents are well-formed
      and conform to the expected structure. This validation process
      helps maintain the integrity and consistency of the XMIR documents
      and ensures that they can be processed correctly by other tools
      or systems that consume them.

        of the main program logic but is essential for understanding, processing, or managing the program. Metas are
        typically used to convey information that can influence how the program is compiled, optimized, or executed.
        They can also be used for documentation purposes, to provide insights into the program's structure,
        dependencies, or other relevant attributes.

          <xs:documentation>
            The `errors` element may contain a collection of `error` elements that have already been identified in the
            program. These errors can be detected by the EO parser or any other additional analyzers, such as style
            checkers or linters. As the XMIR document undergoes various optimization or transformation pipelines, the
            list of errors may expand. It is up to the consumers of the XMIR document to decide whether to address these
            errors or to ignore them and continue processing. Each `error` element provides detailed information about
            the nature of the error, including its severity, the line of code where it was found, and the specific
            checker that identified it. This information is crucial for debugging and ensuring the quality of the EO
            program.

            The `errors` element is designed to help developers identify and resolve issues in their EO programs. By
            providing detailed information about each error, developers can quickly pinpoint the source of the problem
            and take appropriate action. The severity attribute indicates the importance of the error, allowing
            developers to prioritize their efforts. Critical errors may require immediate attention, while warnings can
            be addressed at a later time.

            Additionally, the `errors` element supports the continuous improvement of EO programs. As new analyzers and
            checkers are introduced, they can add their findings to the `errors` element, ensuring that all potential
            issues are documented in a single location. This centralized approach simplifies the debugging process and
            helps maintain the overall quality of the program.
