As per our work policy, this branch naming convention violation results in a **-12 point** penalty. To avoid future penalties and improve collaboration, please name your branches after the ticket number you're working on, such as \\\"`3995`\\\". This helps maintain clarity and aligns with our team's standards.\n\n<!-- It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html) to name Git branches the way you named this one: \"`master`\". You've earned -12 points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of the ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for example, would be \"`3995`\".
