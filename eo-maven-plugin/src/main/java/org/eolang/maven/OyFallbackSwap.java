/**
 * Fallback which can swap primary/secondary repos.
 * <p/>
 * The key purpose of this class is to allow dynamic determination
 * of which Oy (fist or second) to use as primary and which as fallback based on given
 * boolean property.
 * <p/>
 * For {@link PullMojo} this is used to bypass reading from cache by always checking remote
 * first and only fallback to local in case of object miss:
 * <pre>
 *     new PullMojo.FallbackSwapOy(
 *         &lt local &gt,
 *         &lt remote &gt,
 *         this.forceUpdate()
 *     );
 * </pre>
