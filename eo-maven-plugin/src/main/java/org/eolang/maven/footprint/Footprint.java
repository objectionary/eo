/**
 * Footprint is a term used to refer to a trace of an EO program on the file system.
 * It's a fitting analogy with the word's natural meaning, and what it essentially does is trace
 * files that have a specific extension. Footprint enables you to do the following:
 * - Save files that have a specific extension
 * - Load files that have a specific extension
 * - Get a complete list of files that have a specific extension
 * You can find a full list of available methods below.
 * Since Footprint can leave traces on the file system, each Footprint instance will have its
 * own unique way of saving and loading files, and it will have its own place to do so.
 * For instance, {@link FtDefault} will save files directly to a specific location on the file
 * system, while {@link FtCached} will first check the cache directory before delegating
 * the behavior.
 * In other words, Footprint provides useful functionality for working with files that
 * have different extensions.
 * @since 1.0
