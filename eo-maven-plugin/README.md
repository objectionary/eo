This is Maven plugin for EO.

Here is a simple program that gets a year from command line and tells you
whether it's leap or not:

```eo
[args...] > main
  [y] > leap
    or. > @
      and.
        eq. (mod. y 4) 0
        not. (eq. (mod. y 100) 0)
      eq. (mod. y 400) 0
  QQ.io.stdout > @
    QQ.txt.sprintf
      "%d is %sa leap year!"
      (args.get 0).as-int > year!
      if. (leap year:y) "" "not "

```

In order to compile this program, put it into `src/main/eo/main.eo` and then
create a file `pom.xml` with this content (it's just a sample):

```xml
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
        <artifactId>eo-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version><!-- check Maven Central --></version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>register</goal>
              <goal>assemble</goal>
              <goal>transpile</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>test</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>java</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
          <mainClass>org.eolang.Main</mainClass>
          <arguments>
            <argument>main</argument>
            <argument>2008</argument>
          </arguments>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

Then, you just run `mvn clean test` (you will need [Maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/))
and the `.eo` file will be parsed to `.xml` files, transformed to `.java` files,
and then compiled to `.class` files. You can see them all in the `target` directory.
You will need Java 8+.

## How it Works?

The entire process of turning an `.eo` program into an executable
binary code constists of a few steps, which must be done
one after another:

  * **Parsing**.
    It's done by the `org.eolang.parser.Syntax` class in the `eo-parser` module. It takes
    the source code in a plain text format and parses into XML document,
    using [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/) and [Xembly](https://www.xembly.org).
    The output of the parser you can find in the `target/eo/parse` directory.

  * **Optimization**.
    There are a number of [XSL transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT)
    that need to be done
    with the XML document in order to make it ready for compilation.
    Each transformation has its own `.xsl` file in the `eo-parser` directory.
    The class `org.eolang.parser.Program` is responsible for making XSLT
    transformations and the entire list of them is stored in the
    `org.eolang.parser.Pack` class. Some of XLST files are sanity checks (or linters).
    The output of each transformation you can find in the `target/eo/optimize` directory.

  * **Compilation**.
    The class `org.eolang.maven.CompileMojo` in the `eo-maven-plugin` module is responsible
    for putting parsing and optimization steps together and then transforming
    the XML document into a collection of `.java` files. There are a number
    of transformations that do this, they all exist in `.xsl` files.
    The output of this step you can find in the `target/generated-sources` directory.

There is also a module called `eo-runtime`, which includes both `.eo` and `.java` code
for most popular and important objects that any of you will need in order
to write even a simple EO program. There are objects like `string`, `int`, `sprintf`,
`stdout`, and so on. By the way, you may want to contribute there by creating new objects.

## Bypassing object cache

By default, during compilation the plugin will check local cache (`~/.eo`) for required objects
and only download (and cache) them from [Objectionary home](https://github.com/objectionary/home)
in case they are not found locally.

This behaviour can be changed to always download objects from remote by providing 
Maven option `-U` (see [Maven CLI docs](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.1.0/maven-embedder/cli.html)):

```shell
mvn -U clean install
```
