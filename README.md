**EO** (stands for
[Elegant Objects](http://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html) or
ISO 639-1 code of [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto))
is an object-oriented programming language based on
[ùúë-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384).
We're aware of popular semi-OOP languages and we don't think
they are good enough, including:
[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29),
[Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29),
[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B),
[Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk),
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29),
[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP),
[C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29).
All of them have something **we don't tolerate**:

* types ([why?](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/11/10/typing-without-types.html))
* static/class methods or attributes
  ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html))
* classes ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/09/20/oop-without-classes.html))
* implementation inheritance
  ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/09/13/inheritance-is-procedural.html))
* mutability
  ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html)
  and
  [why not?](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/09/07/gradients-of-immutability.html))
* NULL ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/13/why-null-is-bad.html))
* global scope
  ([why?](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/07/03/global-variables.html))
* type casting

* reflection
  ([why?](https://www.yegor256.com/2022/06/05/reflection-means-hidden-coupling.html))
* scalar types and data primitives
* annotations
  ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/04/12/java-annotations-are-evil.html))
* operators
* traits and mixins
  ([why?](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/03/07/traits-and-mixins.html))
* flow control statements (`for`, `while`, `if`, etc)
* [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar)
  ([why?](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/issues/51))

## Quick Start

First, install [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/),
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
Then, you install [eoc](https://github.com/objectionary/eoc):

```bash
npm install -g eolang@0.28.0
```

Then, start with a simple EO program in the `app.eo` file:

```eo
# Just prints hello.
[args] > app
  QQ.io.stdout > @
    "Hello, world!\n"
```

Compile it like this (may take up to a minute or so):

```bash
eoc --easy link
```

Then, run it:

```bash
eoc --easy --alone dataize app
```

You should see "Hello, world!" printed.

## Simple Tutorial

In the example above, we create a new
[abstract object](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/12/01/abstract-objects.html)
named `app`, which has got a single attribute named `@`. The object
attached to the attribute `@` is a copy of the object `stdout` with
a single argument `"Hello, world!"`. The object
`stdout` is also
[abstract](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/12/01/abstract-objects.html).
It can't be used directly, a copy of it has to be created,
with a few requirement arguments provided.
This is how a copy of the object `stdout` is made:

```eo
QQ.io.stdout
  "Hello, world!\n"
```

The indentation in EO is important, just like in Python.
There have to be two spaces
in front of the line in order to go to the deeper level of nesting.
This code can also be written in a "horizontal" notation:

```eo
QQ.io.stdout "Hello, world!"
```

Moreover, it's possible to use brackets in order to group arguments and avoid
ambiguity. For example, instead of using a plain string `"Hello, world!"`
we may want to create a copy of the object `stdout` with a more complex
argument: a copy of the object `sprintf`:

```eo
# Says hello to Jeff.
[] > app
  QQ.io.stdout > @
    QQ.txt.sprintf
      "Hello, %s!"
      * "Jeffrey"
```

Here, the object `sprintf` is also
[abstract](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/12/01/abstract-objects.html).
It is being copied with two arguments: `"Hello, %s!"` and `"Jeffrey"`.
This program can be written using horizontal notation:

```eo
+alias org.eolang.io.stdout
+alias org.eolang.txt.sprintf

# Also says hello to Jeff.
[] > app
  (stdout (sprintf "Hello, %s!" (* "Jeffrey"))) > @
```

The special attribute `@` denotes an object that is being
[decorated](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html).
In this example, the object `app` decorates the copy of the
object `stdout` and through this starts to behave like
the object `stdout`: all attributes of `stdout` become the
attributes of the `app`. The object `app` may have its own
attributes. For example, it's possible to define a new abstract object
inside `app` and use it to build the output string:

```eo
# Says hello to Jeff.
[] > app
  QQ.io.stdout (msg "Jeffrey") > @
  [name] > msg
    QQ.txt.sprintf "Hello, %s!" (* name) > @
```

Now, the object `app` has two "bound" attributes: `@` and `msg`. The attribute
`msg` has an abstract object attached to it, with a single "free" attribute
`name`.

This is how you iterate:

```eo
# Multiplication table.
[args] > app
  malloc.for > @
    0
    [x] >>
      seq > @
        *
          x.put 2
          while
            x.as-number.lt 6 > [i] >>
            [i] >>
              seq > @
                *
                  QQ.io.stdout
                    QQ.txt.sprintf
                      "%d x %d = %d\n"
                      *
                        ^.x
                        ^.x
                        ^.x.as-number.times ^.x
                  ^.x.put
                    ^.x.as-number.plus 1
          true
```

This code will print this:

```text
2 x 2 = 4
3 x 3 = 9
4 x 4 = 16
5 x 5 = 25
```

You can run this benchmark locally with the following commands.
First, to generate the `measures.csv` file:

```shell
mvn clean install --errors --batch-mode -Deo.xslMeasuresFile=measures.csv
```

Then, to generate the report:

```shell
awk -F ',' '{ a[$1]+=$2; s+=$2; } END { for (k in a) \
 printf("%s.xsl\t%d\t%0.2f%%\n", k, a[k], 100 * a[k]/s)}' \
 eo-runtime/measures.csv | sort -g -k 2 | tail -r | column -t | head "-16"
```
