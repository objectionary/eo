This is runtime for EO.

### Note on Dataization logging

By default, dataization process will not log any messages since it
produces quite extensive logs which affect performance.
However, for debugging purposes dataization logging can be enabled.
For that both JUL and Logback levels need to be set to `FINE`.
For tests, it may be accomplished by amending the following two files:
_test\resources\jul.properties_:
```
.level=FINE
```
_test\resources\logback.xml_:
```
<logger name="org.eolang.Dataized" level="FINE"/>
```
After that, dataization will be logged up until nesting level 3.
If for some reason deeper dataization log is required it can be
achieved by jvm property `-Dmax.dataization.log=<N>`
where `N` is an integer representing desired nesting level to log.

## How to run tests
You can run tests just like this:
```
mvn clean test
```

If you want to run tests separately, you can run:
```
mvn clean test -Dtest="{test}"
```
Here the variable `{test}` is the full name of the test, or several test names separated by commas (`,`). 

For example, this `EO` test:
```
[] > prints-itself
  assert-that > @
    length.
      as-phi $
    $.greater-than 0
```

you can run just like this:
```
mvn clean test -Dtest="EOorg.EOeolang.EOprints_itselfTest"
```
