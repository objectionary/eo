# Test.
# @todo #2931:30min Enable heap tests. The tests were disabled because they stopped working
#  when \rho attribute became immutable. Need to find out what's going on and enable them.
#  Tests: malloc-returns-different-pointers, malloc-return-error, increments-pointer,
#  mallocs-do-not-overlap, write-and-read-without-error
