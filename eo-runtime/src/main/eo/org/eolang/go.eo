# Non-conditional forward and backward jumps.
# Forward jump instantly returns provided object to `g.forward` without touching
# all the code below.
# Backward jump instantly returns provided to `go.to` abstract object
#
# Forward jump may look like this:
#
# ```
# go.to
#   [g]
#     seq > @
#       *
#         g.forward true
#         stdout "Will never be printed"
# ```
#
# Backward jump may be done this way:
#
# ```
# go.to
#   [g]
#     seq > @
#       *
#         stdout "Will be printed forever"
#         g.backward
# ```
# Go to.
