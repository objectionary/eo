# Runtime.
#
# The runtime object provides a collection of test cases that verify
# core EO language functionality and behavior.
#
# @todo #4235:35min Move all tests from `runtime.eo` to other objects.
#  For now runtime is just a set of runtime tests. Instead of having this, let's move its tests
#  to the other objects, which tests are most suitable for.
