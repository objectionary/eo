# Compile Time Instruction (CTI).
#
# The object may be used to add compile time information to
# other objects. This mechanism is somehow similar to annotations in,
# for example, Java and C#. For example, the object makes it possible
# to highlight deprecated methods. EO compiler, when it meets the
# `cli` object, takes its `message` and prints to the log/console
# with the `level` severity level (use `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR`).
