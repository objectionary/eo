# The sprintf object allows you to format and output text depending
# on the arguments passed to it.
# When arguments are processed - they're dataized and converted to objects
# depending on next flags:
# - %s - converts object to `string`
# - %d - converts object to `int`
# - %f - converts object to `float`
# - %x - converts object to `bytes`
# - %b - converts object to boolean, `true` or `false`.
