    # Tries to find object in hash map by given `key`.
    # Here `key` must be dataizable.
    # The returned object has two attributes: `exists` and `get`.
    # The `exists` attribute is either `true`, if object was found,
    # or `false` if was not.
    # The `get` attribute returns either found object, or `error` if
    # the object wasn't found.
    # @todo #3251:30min Find a way to link hash code and index of key.
    #  Right now map is implemented as `tuple` of objects where every
    #  element is composition of three entities: hash, key and value.
    #  When we try to find an element in hash map by key (K1) we're
    #  calculating hash of K1 (H1) and trying to find the entity where
    #  `entity.hash` (H2) is equal to H1. This search is implemented by
    #  simple reducing initial hash map `tuple` and obviously slow - O(n).
    #  We need to find a way to get a right index of entity in hash map
    # `tuple` just by applying some simple operation on H1, similar to it's
    #  implemented in other programming languages. Then we'll get O(1) on
    #  `found` operation.
