# Temporary directory.
# For Unix/MacOS uses the path supplied by the first environment variable
# found in the list TMPDIR, TMP, TEMP, TEMPDIR.
# If none of these are found, "/tmp" is used.
#
# For Windows uses the path reported by the Windows "GetTempPath" API function which
# takes the first environment variable in the list TMP, TEMP, USERPROFILE.
# If none of these are found, it returns the Windows directory (C:\Windows).
