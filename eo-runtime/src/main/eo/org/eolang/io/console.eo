# The `console` object is basic I/O object that allows to
# interact with operation system console.
#
# Imagine, operation system console input is "Hello, world!"
# Here's how you can use `console` object as input
# ```
# seq > @
#   *
#     console                # error
#     console.read 4 > c1    # "Hell".as-bytes
#     c1.read 4 > c2         # "o, w".as-bytes
#     console.read 4 > c3    # "orld".as-bytes
#     c2.read 4 > c4         # "!".as-bytes
# ```
#
# Here 16 bytes are read from operation system console.
# Every `console.read` object returns an input block.
# Every input block is requested portion of bytes read
# from console, so it's dataizable.
# Also every input block has object `read` which allows to get
# next input block with next portion of bytes read from console
#
# Here's how you can write to `console`.
# ```
# seq > @
#   *
#     console.write "Hello" > o1
#     o1.write ", " > o2
#     console.write "world!" > o3
# ```
#
# Here `"Hello, world!".as-bytes` bytes are printed to console.
# The object `write` is an output block.
# It dataizes given argument, converts it to string,
# prints it to operation system console and returns next output block
# ready to `write` again.
#
# Console is platform dependent, which means the internal algorithm is different for
# Posix and Windows. Defining the console is happen every time you "touch" `console` object.
# If you use it as input/output:
# ```
# console.read 2 > i1
# i1.read 2 > i2
# i2.read 2 > i3
# ...
# ```
#
# it works faster than:
# ```
# console.read 2 > i1
# console.read 2 > i2
# console.read 2 > i3
# ...
# ```
# That why it's better to use it sequentially.
