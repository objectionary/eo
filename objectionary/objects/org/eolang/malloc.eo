# The `malloc` object is an abstraction of a storage of data in heap
# memory. The implementation of `malloc` is platform dependent. It may
# use either OS-level or VM-level memory management mechanism.
#
# There are two ways of how `malloc` could be used:
#
# First, when the size of the required memory block is known beforehand:
#
# ```
# malloc.of
#   8
#   [m]
#     m.put 10 > @
# ```
#
# Here, the first argument is a size of allocated block in memory, the second argument
# is the scope where memory block is available for reading and writing. When `malloc.of` is
# dataized, it processes the scope, clears the block and returns the result of scope dataization.
# Therefore, users do not need to manage memory cleanup after allocation.
#
# Second, when the size is not known upfront, but there exists
# an object ready to be dataized and placed into the memory block
# (the size of the block will be equal to the amount of bytes
# produced by the dataization of the object):
#
# ```
# malloc.for
#   "Hello world!"
#   [m]
#     m.put "Hello, Jeff!" > @
# ```
#
# Here, the first argument is an object which will be dataized, then a block in memory of given data
# size is allocated and the data is written to the block. The second argument is the same scope as
# in the first example.
#
# Consider the next code:
# ```
# malloc.of
#   8                         # allocate 8 bytes length block in memory
#   [m]
#     seq > @
#       *
#         m.write 2 "Hello"   # write object "Hello" with offset 2
#         m.read 3 4          # read 4 bytes from offset 3 -> "ello"
#         m.put 42            # write object 42 with offset 0
#         m.get               # just get all the data from the memory block -> 42
#         m.size              # get size of the block
#         m.id                # get identifier of the block
#         m.@                 # the same as m.get
# ```
# Here the void attribute in the scope object is memory-block object which provides API to write
# and read data to the memory.
