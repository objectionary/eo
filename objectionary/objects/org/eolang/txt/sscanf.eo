# Reads formatted input from a string.
# This object has two free attributes:
# 1. `format` - is a formatter string (e.g. "Hello, %s!")
# 2. `read` - is a string where data exists (e.g. "Hello, John!")
# returns a `org.eolang.tuple` of formatted values (e.g. * "John").
# Supported formatters are:
# - %d - parse as integer and convert to `number`
# - %f - parse as float and convert to `number`
# - %s - parse as string and convert to `string`.
