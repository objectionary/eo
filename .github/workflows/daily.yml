      # @todo #2085:90min Add GitHub action step to create an issue.
      #  It would be convenient to add github action step that will create an
      #  issue in case of any of the tests is failed. We can do it through
      #  <a href="https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue">create-an-issue</a>
      #  action. Also, you can read about that problem in that discussion:
